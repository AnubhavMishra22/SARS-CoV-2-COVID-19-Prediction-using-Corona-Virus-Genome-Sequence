SARS CoV-2 / COVID-19 Prediction using Corona Virus Genome Sequence. Metagenomic RNA sequencing of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like corona viruses (genus Beta corona virus, sub genus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China.So we have done this and explained some facts with the help of some graphs made through matplot.
